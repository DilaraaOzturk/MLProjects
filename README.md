# MLProjects
Open-access machine learning projects for students, developers, and curious minds worldwide.
# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

This repository will host a collection of machine learning projects implemented in Google Colab. Each notebook will focus on a specific algorithm or technique, demonstrating practical applications and clear explanations.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

I'm currently building this portfolio step by step. Upcoming notebooks will include:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Clustering Algorithms
- and more...

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, NumPy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Google Colab
